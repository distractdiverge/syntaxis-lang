# 1. Overview

Syntaxis is a constructed written language designed as a Cognitive Interface Language (CIL) for structured human–AI interaction and internal cognitive refinement.

It is not intended to be:
- A naturalistic spoken language
- A culture-building world language
- A purely logical language in the Loglan/Lojban tradition

It is intended to be:
- Deterministic
- Composable
- Epistemically explicit
- Meta-cognitively structured
- AI-trainable
- Cognitively expanding for human use

Syntaxis is primarily written. A glyph layer may supplement the canonical ASCII layer.

# 2. Problem Statement

Natural languages:
- Conflate observation and inference
- Omit epistemic certainty
- Blur emotional and logical states
- Rely heavily on context
- Introduce ambiguity in role marking
- Are inefficient for AI prompt precision

Current logical conlangs:
- Over-optimize for formal logic
- Under-support emotional/meta cognition
- Lack probabilistic encoding
- Are not optimized for transformer training

There is currently no language optimized simultaneously for:
1. Human cognitive structuring
2. Human–AI interface clarity
3. Explicit epistemic encoding
4. Relational geometry awareness
5. Meta-thought tagging

Syntaxis addresses this gap.

# 3. Design Goals

## 3.1 Determinism
Each sentence must be parseable without ambiguity given the grammar specification.

## 3.2 Explicit Epistemology
All statements must encode epistemic class (observation, inference, model, etc.).

## 3.3 Relational Clarity
Semantic roles must be explicitly marked.

## 3.4 Agglutinative Composability
Words and verbs must stack meaning in predictable modular ways.

## 3.5 Dual-System Awareness
The grammar must support explicit dual-number marking to model dyadic cognition (e.g., human + AI).

## 3.6 AI Compatibility
- Canonical ASCII representation required
- No irregular morphology
- Low ambiguity
- Tokenization-friendly design
- No silent characters

## 3.7 Cognitive Expansion
The language should:
- Increase probabilistic reasoning
- Increase metacognitive awareness
- Improve relational modeling
- Encourage separation of data vs interpretation

---

# 4. Non-Goals

Syntaxis is NOT:

- A naturalistic aesthetic conlang
- A culture-building global language
- A poetry-first language
- A language prioritizing phonetic beauty
- A direct descendant of any existing language

---

# 5. Influences

Syntaxis draws structural inspiration from:

- Korean (agglutinative morphology, explicit particles)
- Japanese (SOV closure logic)
- Mandarin Chinese (topic-comment structure)
- Lithuanian (case marking, dual number preservation)
- French (abstract precision vocabulary)
- Software architecture principles (modular design, version control)

No direct borrowing of vocabulary is mandated.

---

# 6. System Layers

Syntaxis consists of multiple layers:

1. Core Grammar Engine
2. Lexicon Architecture
3. Glyph System
4. Meta-Thought Encoding Layer
5. AI Interface Specification
6. Evolution & Versioning Protocol

Each layer is independently documented.

---

# 7. Canonical Representation

All Syntaxis content must have:

- A canonical ASCII representation
- Deterministic role markers
- Explicit meta markers

Glyph rendering is optional but secondary.

---

# 8. Intended Use Cases

- AI prompt precision
- Journaling with epistemic discipline
- Cognitive modeling
- Dyadic reasoning with AI systems
- Structured planning
- Emotional state encoding
- Complex abstraction compression

---

# 9. Long-Term Vision

Long-term goals may include:

- Local AI fine-tuned on Syntaxis corpus
- Structured dual-cognition modeling
- Cognitive OS implementation
- Semi-formal reasoning engine
- Symbolic + LLM hybrid integration

# 10. Architectural Decision Log (ADL)

## ADL-001
Decision: Syntaxis will be primarily written.
Status: Approved
Rationale: Written form allows precision and deterministic structure.

## ADL-002
Decision: ASCII canonical form required.
Status: Approved
Rationale: AI compatibility and tokenization simplicity.

## ADL-003
Decision: Mandatory epistemic tagging.
Status: Approved
Rationale: Enforces cognitive discipline.

## ADL-004
Decision: Dual number support required.
Status: Approved
Rationale: Enables explicit modeling of human-AI dyadic cognition.

## ADL-005
Decision: Agglutinative morphology over fusional.
Status: Approved
Rationale: Predictable stacking improves AI learnability.

# 11. Open Questions

- Should emotional tagging be mandatory in all sentences?
- Should glyph layer encode semantic radicals?
- Should probability encoding be numeric-only?
- Should lexical roots follow strict phonotactics?

These will be resolved in later artifacts.
