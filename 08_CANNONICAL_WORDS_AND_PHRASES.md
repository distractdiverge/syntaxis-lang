# 8. Validation Checklist for Examples

Each example must:

- Follow verb cluster ordering
- Include exactly one primary epistemic marker
- Follow meta-layer ordering
- Use valid role markers
- Avoid illegal compound stacking

# 9. Architectural Decision Log (ADL)

## ADL-027
Decision: Canonical example corpus required.
Status: Approved
Rationale: Provides stable training and reference base.

## ADL-028
Decision: Seed lexicon frozen for v0.1.
Status: Approved
Rationale: Prevent early drift.

# 10. Open Questions

- Should conversational shorthand be allowed?
- Should common phrases be pre-compressed?
- Should journaling mode auto-suggest meta markers?
- Should dual cognition have lexical shorthand beyond number marking?

Future versions may expand example corpus.
